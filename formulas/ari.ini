description = "Ari is a minimalistic, flexible three-column blog theme. The theme uses CSS3 media queries for its responsive layout and is therefore optimized for tablet pcs and smart phones (the theme switches to a two-column layout when viewed on a horizontal iPad screen, and to a one-column layout on iPhones). You can also choose a dark color scheme and the backgound-, text- and link-colors can be customized in the theme options page."
