description = "Sidebar-Login has both a widget and a template tag to allow you to have a login form in the sidebar of your wordpress powered blog.

It lets users login, and then redirects them back to the page they logged in from rather than the backend, it also shows error messages.

You can configure the plugin in `Admin &#62; Settings &#62; Sidebar Login` after installing it.

If you&#039;d like to contribute to the plugin you can find it on GitHub: <https://github.com/mikejolley/sidebar-login>."
