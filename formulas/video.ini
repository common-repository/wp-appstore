description = "Add VideoPress videos stored on WordPress.com to your self-hosted WordPress.org site through the use of simple shortcodes. Edit video metadata directly from your blog&#039;s administrative interface.

The VideoPress plugin allows blog administrators to upload new videos to their WordPress.com video account and manage existing videos from the convenience of their self-hosted WordPress.org blog&#039;s administrative interface. Authors can add any VideoPress video into a blog post through the use of a simple shortcode and customizations.

This plugin allows you to click a button to login to your WordPress.com video blog, retrieve a video&#039;s `&#x5b;videopress xyz\]` shortcode, and insert it into your post. You can specify the width and height of the video container with w= h= shortcode attributes. You can restrict playback to only Freedom-loving formats using a shortcode parameter of `freedom=true`. You can autoplay a video by setting a shortcode parameter of `autoplay=true`. You can force a Flash video embed by setting a shortcode parameter of `flashonly=true`. The following are all valid shortcodes:

*   `&#x5b;videopress xyz\]` uses your default theme content_width if present, otherwise uses 400px as width.
*   `&#x5b;videopress xyz w=640\]` specifies the width of video container to be 640px while preserving the aspect ratio.
*   `&#x5b;videopress xyz w=640 h=360\]` specifies both width and height of the video container.
*   `&#x5b;videopress xyz h=300\]` specifies the height of the video container to be 300px, while preserving the aspect ratio.
*   `&#x5b;videopress xyz freedom=true\]` display videos in only Freedom-loving formats (currently Ogg with Theora video and Vorbis audio).
