description = "Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet web service to see if they look like spam or not and lets you review the spam it catches under your blog&#039;s &quot;Comments&quot; admin screen.

Major new features in Akismet 2.5 include:

*   A comment status history, so you can easily see which comments were caught or cleared by Akismet, and which were spammed or unspammed by a moderator
*   Links are highlighted in the comment body, to reveal hidden or misleading links
*   If your web host is unable to reach Akismet&#039;s servers, the plugin will automatically retry when your connection is back up
*   Moderators can see the number of approved comments for each user
*   Spam and Unspam reports now include more information, to help improve accuracy

PS: You&#039;ll need an \[Akismet.com API key\]\[1\] to use it. Keys are free for personal blogs, with paid subscriptions available for businesses and commercial sites.
