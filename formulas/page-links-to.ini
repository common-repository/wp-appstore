description = "This plugin allows you to make a WordPress page or post link to a URL of your choosing, instead of its WordPress page or post URL. It also will redirect people who go to the old (or &quot;normal&quot;) URL to the new one you&#039;ve chosen (`301 Moved Permanently` redirects are standard, but you can choose a `302 Moved Temporarily` redirect if you wish).

This functionality is useful for setting up navigational links to non-WordPress sections of your site or to off-site resources.

You can also use it to create a hand-crafted menu that links to pages, posts, categories, or anything within your site."
