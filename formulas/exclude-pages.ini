description = "This plugin adds a checkbox, “include this page in menus”, which is checked by default. If you uncheck it, the page will not appear in any listings of pages (which includes, and is *usually* limited to, your page navigation menus).

Pages which are children of excluded pages also do not show up in menu listings. (An alert in the editing screen, underneath the &quot;include&quot; checkbox allows you to track down which ancestor page is affecting child pages in this way.)"
